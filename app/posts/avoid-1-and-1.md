#PSA: Avoid 1and1 Internet

After having a _ton_ of trouble with [1and1 domains][1] recently, I have _finally_ decided to stop being in denial that they were a horrible company, and just help all you people out as well. (As a very real example of their horrible service, [my website][2] is down right now, and they won’t let me fix it, because it’s “updating” [?])

##Never use 1and1 for _anything_

I really hate to ever bash a company like this, because I know that they are probably just doing their best - even if that sometimes just means doing their best to help _themselves_ make money, but 1and1 is not good for anything, and while they may be cheaper up front for some stuff, they will nickel and dime you until you’ve way overpaid any of their competitors.

After I finally came out of my denial that they were just simply a horrible business to work with, a simple [Google search for “avoid 1and1”][3] turned up [a][4] [T][5][O][6][N][7] [o][8][f][9] [p][10][e][11][o][12][p][13][l][14][e][15] saying the exact same thing, that I just wasn’t wise enough to listen to before I bought 3 domain names with them :/

Just take my word for it: don’t use 1and1 internet. Ever. It’s not worth it.

**Edit**: About 5 minutes after I wrote this, I realized how hopeless this sounds… Hover.com offers great, simple Domain management services. I will be transferring all of my domains over to them ASAP :)

    <p>Hey there! I'm Joah. I'm a self-taught frontend developer currently living in the Austin metro area. I have a beautiful <a target="_blank" href="https://im.haley.fyi">wife</a> and two awesome kids. </p>
    <p>I was born second of seven kids, I was homeschooled K-12, and started my career at the age of 17.</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games, taking long walks, and correcting my coworkers' spelling mistakes in Slack.</p>

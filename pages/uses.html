<h2>The Essentials</h2>
<section class="uses">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Touch-Intel-2-3GHz/dp/B07SKPVLZ4">Mid-2019 15" Macbook Pro</a>
      <p>
        As much as I don't love the keyboard on this laptop (the 2019 16" model is much better), it gets the job done, and I've been very happy with it otherwise.

    <li>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07T92DDH2">iPad Pro 11"</a>
      <p>
        Beautiful tablet, great for taking notes in meetings or watching movies while travelling.
      </p>

    <li>
      <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4">Google Pixel 4 XL</a>
      <p>
        I've owned every major generation of the Pixel, I love this phone.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q9MJKBV">Bose NC 700</a>
      <p>
        Possibly the best QOL purchase I've made as a remote worker, noise cancelling headphones allow me to work anywhere in isolation. I've also owned the Sony <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM2/dp/B074KDJVS2">XM2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1">XM3</a>, which had slightly better noise cancelling, but the Bose NC 700 has the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth, which is pretty cool, and very convenient.

        When using my Mac, this functions as an app dock/smart home controller. When using my gaming PC, it's loaded up with soundboard clips that I play in-game. Sorry, I'm that guy.
